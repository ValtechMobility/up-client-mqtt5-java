= How to test?

== locally

The following frameworks are used for testing

- junit
- assertJ
- mockito
- testcontainers (needs docker)

All tests will be executed via `mvn clean install` and can be executed individually by `mvn test`

== in CI

Tests will be executed in GitHub actions on every pull request and in each release pipeline.

== Test details

- we will execute tests against a mqtt broker which will be created in a dockerContainer therefore a testcontainers compatible container runtime is needed (e.g. docker).
